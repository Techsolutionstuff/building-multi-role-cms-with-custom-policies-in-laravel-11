In this tutorial, we’ll build a Multi-Role CMS in Laravel 11 using custom policies to manage user roles such as Admin, Editor, and Author. Policies allow us to control user access dynamically and give specific permissions based on roles.

Once the policy class has been registered, you may add methods for each action it authorizes. If you used the --model option when generating your policy via the Artisan console, it will already contain methods for the viewAny, view, create, update, delete, restore, and forceDelete actions.
